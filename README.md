## Monitoring, Controlling and Cost reducing: Energy, Water and Gas consumption
### IoT Solution by LoRaWAN for McDonaldâ€™s restaurants
---
<div style="text-align: justify">We split our project into two categories one is the hardware part, and the other is the software part. We work as a five-person team. One of my colleagues and I are working on the software part. We prepare the device configurations to connect with the lorawan gateway and send data to the network server. We use the chirpstack network server in this solution. The lorawan gateway sends data to the network server in encrypted mode. After receiving the payload, we write JavaScript code to decode the values as device documentation. When we get the correct values after decoding, we integrate the values into the application server which is thingsboard io. In thingsboard we will get all values in the deviceâ€™s latest telemetry. From telemetry, we can redirect the values to the dashboard and create a beautiful dashboard for data visualization. Meanwhile, we can create a rule chain to process the values, like data aggregation, daily and monthly consumption and send an alarm to customers in a critical situation and so on.

-	To monitor and control the Energy consumption,

- Indoor and Outdoor temperature and humidity, 

- People counting, 

- Water and Gas consumption. 

We design a system by using a famous IoT platform (PaaS) and LoRaWAN based sensors with MikroTik gateway and ChirpStack Network server. 
Also, we used the MQTT protocol to publish the values to the Cloud for some reason. We used DRAGINO, EASTRON, BMeters and ADEUNIS sensor brands.
