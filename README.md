# SYSTEM-FOR-EFFICIENCY-OF-ELECTRICITY-CONSUMPTION

-	To monitor and control the Energy consumption,

- Indoor and Outdoor temperature and humidity, 

- People counting, 

- Water and Gas consumption. 

We design a system by using a famous IoT platform (PaaS) and LoRaWAN based sensors with MikroTik gateway and ChirpStack Network server. 
Also, we used the MQTT protocol to publish the values to the Cloud for some reason. We used DRAGINO, EASTRON, BMeters and ADEUNIS sensor brands.
